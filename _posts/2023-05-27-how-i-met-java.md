## Java How to Program

My first programming language was Java. I learned it from a book called Java How to Program by Harvey M. Deitel and Paul J. Deitel in 2005. It was a comprehensive and practical guide that taught me the basics of object-oriented programming and Java syntax.

It was a delightful and exhilarating experience. I felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as I explored the possibilities of creating and manipulating code. Programming opened up a new world for me, unlike anything I had experienced before. 


## Introduction of Multi Core Processors

The early 2000s marked a significant milestone in the history of computing, as the first multicore processors were introduced to the market. Java was quick to adapt to this new paradigm. Java supported concurrency and parallelism since its inception, but it also introduced new features and libraries to take advantage of multicore processors. Java 1.5, which was released in September 2004 which 5 added the java.util.concurrent package. This package provided a set of classes and interfaces that enabled developers to write concurrent programs that could utilize multiple CPUs. The package included features such as thread pools, atomic variables, locks, synchronizers, and executors.

My first notebook was a Dell Inspiron 6400 with an Intel Core 2 Duo T5600 processor. This processor belonged to the Intel Core family, which was one of the first to introduce multi-core technology for notebooks. I was able to use Java to take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of my CPU cores.
