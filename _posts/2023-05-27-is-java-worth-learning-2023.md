Java was designed in the early 1990s with a specific set of goals and principles. Since then, the world of computing has changed dramatically, with new paradigms, technologies and challenges emerging. None of those developments could have been foreseen by the designers of Java. So, after so many years, has Java become obsolete? This is a question that many programmers and software engineers ask themselves, especially when they compare Java with newer and more expressive languages. In this article, we will examine some of the arguments for and against Java's relevance in the modern era.


## Ability To Adapt

Java is a programming language that has demonstrated its durability and flexibility over the years. It has evolved with the changing needs and trends of the software industry, incorporating new features and paradigms. 

Java 5 released in 2004. Major changes were introduction of generics, annotations, enums and java.util.concurrent package.

java 6 released in 2006. Major changes were introduction of JAX-WS and improvements of JDBC, JAXB, Annotations and Garbage Collectors.

Java 7 released in 2011. Major changes were introduction of dynamic JVM languages, New IO and fork/join framework.

Java 8 released in 2014. Major changes were introduction of Lambda expressions, streams, completable futures, new Date & Time API and improvements to annotations. Lambda expressions allows for functional style programming in Java. 

Java 9 released in 2017. Major changes were introduction of modules, reactive streams and new garbage collectors.

## Thriving Ecosystem

Over the years, the Java ecosystem has thrived and become one of the most popular and widely used platforms for software development. Many successful community projects have emerged from the Java community, showcasing the diversity and innovation of its members. Some examples of these projects are:

- Apache Spark: a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing, supporting SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph analytics.
- Spring Framework: A comprehensive framework for building enterprise applications using dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, web services, and more.
- Spring Boot: a framework that simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that can run with minimal configuration.
- Hibernate: an object-relational mapping tool that provides a powerful and flexible way to persist Java objects to various types of databases.
- JUnit: a simple and elegant framework for writing and running unit tests, supporting test-driven development and continuous integration.
- Android: an open source operating system for mobile devices, based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software.

These are just some of the many examples of the Java community projects that have contributed to the advancement of software engineering and technology. The Java ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, offering new opportunities and challenges for developers and users alike.


## Large Skill Pool

Java is still among the most popular programming languages in the world, according to various metrics and rankings. According to Github[1], Stackoverflow[2] and Jetbrains[3] reports, Java is the third most popular programming language, excluding markup and query langues.   

One of the reasons fueling Java's popularity is its ease of access to a large skill pool of developers. This creates a positive feedback loop that increases the demand for Java skills in the market.


## Vast Existing Code Bases

Java is a programming language that has been widely adopted for many applications over the years. It has proven to be reliable, versatile and scalable, making it suitable for complex and large-scale projects. Even though newer technologies and languages may emerge, Java will not become obsolete anytime soon. Many existing projects that are built with Java will continue to run and require maintenance and support for the foreseeable future. Therefore, Java remains a relevant and valuable skill for developers to have.


## Conclusion 

Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It has a strong and loyal community of developers who continue to create and maintain applications with it. Java is a versatile and powerful language that can handle various challenges and domains. Learning Java in 2023 can be a rewarding and beneficial experience for anyone interested in software development.
